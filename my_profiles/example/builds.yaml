# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.
# This example includes 4 separate builds, ranging from the regional (global) to location (county) level.
# You can comment-out, remove, or add as many builds as you'd like.

# Each build needs a name, a defined subsampling process, and geographic attributes used for subsampling.
# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

# The default config file, `./defaults/default_config.yaml` has reasonable default subsampling methods for each geographic resolution.
# These subsample primarily from the area of interest ("focus"), and add in background ("contextual") sequences from the rest of the world.
# Contextual sequences that are genetically similar to (hamming distance) and geographically near the focal sequences are heavily prioritized.

# In this example, we use these default methods. See other templates for examples of how to customize this subsampling scheme.

builds:
  # Focus on King County (location) in Washington State (division) in the USA (country)
  king-county: # name of the build; this can be anything
    subsampling_scheme: location # what subsampling method to use (see default_config.yaml)
    region: North America
    country: USA
    division: Washington
    location: King County
    # Whatever your lowest geographic area is (here, 'location' since we are doing a county in the USA)
    # list 'up' from here the geographic area that location is in. 
    # Here, King County is in Washington state, is in USA, is in North America.

  # Zoom out one level: this build focuses on all of Washington State
  washington-state:
    subsampling_scheme: division # we named the subsampling scheme meant for divisions accordingly; you can rename these whatever you'd like
    region: North America
    country: USA
    division: Washington
    # Here, Washington state is in USA, is in North America.

  # This build focuses on the entire U.S.
  my_usa_build:
    subsampling_scheme: country
    region: North America
    country: USA
    # Here, USA is in North America

  # This build foocuses on all of North America
  my_north_america_build:
    subsampling_scheme: region
    region: North America

  # This build samples evenly from the globe
  my_global_build:
    subsampling_scheme: region_global

# Here, you can specify what type of auspice_config you want to use
# and what description you want. These will apply to all the above builds.
# If you want to specify specific files for each build - you can!
