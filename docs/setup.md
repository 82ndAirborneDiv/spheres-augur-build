# Setup  

For this tutorial, there are three components to set up. Depending on what you'd like to do, you may need one, two, or all of these components.  


## 1. Make a copy of this tutorial [required for all]  

There are two ways to do this:
* [Recommended] If you're familiar with git, clone this repository either via the web interface, a GUI such as gitkraken, or the command line:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/nextstrain/sarscov2-tutorial.git
```

* [Alternative] If you're not familiar with git, you can also just download a copy of these files by navigating to [https://github.com/nextstrain/sarscov2-tutorial](https://github.com/nextstrain/sarscov2-tutorial) and clicking on the green 'Clone or download' button. 


## 2. Install augur [required for running analysis]  

You can find instructions for installing augur [here](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/introduction).

Note there are many options for installing augur, including local installations from `conda`, `pip`, and from source, and container installation - take a minute to look at which may be best for you.

If you are running Windows, we recommend working through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - you can find out how to set this up [here](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/windows-help).


## 3. Install auspice [required only for local visualization; web-based, no-install options available]

You can find instructions for installing auspice [here](https://nextstrain.github.io/auspice/introduction/install).
